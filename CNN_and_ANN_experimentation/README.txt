This folder contains the results of my experimentations on quantization, clustering and pruning for an example of ANN and CNN each.

The numerical results of the experiments are summed up as a table in results_table.xlsx.

For both ANN and CNN, the files ANN_base.ipynb and CNN_base.ipnyb contain the python code for generating the baseline models, which are then saved under ANN_base and CNN_base.

The folders with names ending in quant, clustered and pruned respectively contain both the pyhton code and resulting of files of experiments on quantization, clustering and pruning.
